WHAT IS GOAT?
GOAT allows you to create, track and share your personal and professional
goals!! The goal creation process allows the user to create goals on
their time frame is tailored to their needs. The user can add new goals,
update existing goals and archive goals that don't suit them anymore. Users
can also give goals a personal point value. Making progress on a goal
earns the user points for redemption in our Goat store.
Users can share mutual goals for friendly competition or support or keep
their goals private behind our secure server.
